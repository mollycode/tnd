                	<h1>Victor Glass: America's Quest for Universal Broadband Services</h1>
                    <div class="left">
                    	<p>The U.S. government has committed itself to universal broadband service availability and high customer adoption rates. This short course will focus on three basic questions whose answers are critical to developing effective government policy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the definition of universal broadband service? </li>
                            <li>Where are we now?</li>
                            <li>How do we reach the goal?</li>
						</ul>
<p>The answer to each question is controversial. This course will focus on key market developments, regulatory history and recent government proposals that will help the viewer develop informed opinions on the broadband debate. A deeper goal is to develop a framework for evaluating other government policy issues. As you will see, the broadband debate is a microcosm of the fiscal debates in Washington (e.g. role of government, type of regulation needed, who pays and how much).
No prerequisites are necessary for the course. A basic knowledge of economics would be helpful but not required. All technical terms taken from network design and economic theory will be explained by the presenter.
