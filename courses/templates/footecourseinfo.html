                    	<p>In our Three Nights and Done course, we will explore the world of baseball and how a pro watches and, even more importantly, analyzes a baseball game. We will start with how a game is initiated all the way to the last out of the game. </p>
						<p>We will analyze virtually ever position on the field, paying close attention to the middle of the diamond. The pitcher, catcher, shortstop and centerfielder will be discussed with the desired result a better understanding of their importance in the overall development of each game. We will analyze the offense and defense and how the managers influence their team's deployment of both. At the end of our three nights together, you will never watch a baseball game the same way again.</p>
